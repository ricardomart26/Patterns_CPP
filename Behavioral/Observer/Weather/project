Project: Weather Monitoring System

Objective: Create a C++ program that simulates a weather monitoring system using the Observer Pattern. This project models weather data as the subject and various displays as observers, which receive and display real-time weather updates.

Description:

    Subject (Weather Data): Define a WeatherData class that acts as the subject. This class will maintain weather-related data such as temperature, humidity, and pressure. It should include methods to register, remove, and notify observers.

    Observer (Weather Display): Create an Observer interface or abstract class that declares an update method. This method will be implemented by concrete observer classes to display weather data.

    Concrete Observer Classes (Weather Displays): Implement concrete observer classes for different types of weather displays, such as a current conditions display, a statistics display, and a forecast display. Each observer should register with the WeatherData subject and update its display when notified.

    User Interface: Create a simple command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to view weather data from various displays. Users should be able to add and remove displays dynamically.

    Realistic Data Simulation: Simulate realistic weather data updates. For instance, you can generate random values for temperature, humidity, and pressure and periodically update the WeatherData subject with these values.

    Observable Logic: Implement logic in the WeatherData class to notify registered observers when weather data changes. Notify observers with updated temperature, humidity, and pressure values.

    Display Logic: In the observer classes, implement the update method to receive the new weather data and display it. You can format and print the data to the console or update a graphical display, depending on your chosen user interface.

    Testing: Test your weather monitoring system by adding and removing different types of weather displays. Ensure that observers receive and display updates correctly.

Learning Objectives:

    Observer Pattern: Learn how to implement the Observer Pattern in C++ to establish a one-to-many dependency between objects.

    Object-Oriented Design: Practice designing classes and interfaces to model a complex system with dynamic dependencies.

    User Interface Interaction: If you choose to create a GUI, you can also learn about GUI development in C++. Alternatively, you can design a CLI-based interface.

    Realistic Data Simulation: Explore techniques for simulating realistic data updates in a software system.

    Dynamic Registration and Removal: Understand how to dynamically register and remove observers from the subject, providing flexibility and modularity.

By working on this project, you'll gain a solid understanding of the Observer Pattern and its practical applications in software development, especially for building systems that involve dynamic data updates and multiple subscribers.
